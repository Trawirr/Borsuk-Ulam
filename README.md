# Borsuk-Ulam

The Borsuk-Ulam theorem states that for any continuous function mapping a sphere of dimension n to n-dimensional Euclidean space, there exist at least two antipodal points that map to the same point in the Euclidean space.
The program utilizes mathematical and geometric calculations and APIs to iterate through the sphere (Earth) and check for pairs of points that satisfy the Borsuk-Ulam condition for temperature.
